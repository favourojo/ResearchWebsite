### About
The software resource I will be focusing on is RStudio.
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser. RStudio is relevant to my topic because R is the language that focuses on data analytics and visualizes the data with graphs or plots. I have experience with the software RStudio from my previous Data Analytics course that is offered here at Allegheny College. After utilizing the software resource for several months my last semester, I became very interested in the software resource and wanted to create more with the resource.

### Features

In RStudio, there are many features that individuals are open to use and utilize several features to create their work. For instance, there is a customizable workbench with all of the tools required to work with R in one place (console, source, plots, workspace, help, history, etc.). There is also a syntax highlighting editor with code completion. With that, individuals are able to execute code directly from the source editor (line, selection, or file). RStudio also has full support for authoring Sweave and TeX documents. RStudio is able to run on all machines such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. It also has a community-maintained FreeBSD port. RStudio can also be run as a server, which enables multiple users to access the RStudio IDE using a web browser.
