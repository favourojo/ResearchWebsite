+ Identify what research question (or central goal) related to your research project you will attempt to answer with an experiment.

```
Does certain factors such as wealth and notoriety of a community affect the crime rate in a positive or a negative way?
```

+ Identify what experimental findings that will answer your research question. What data will
your experiment produce?
```
I believe the experimental findings that will help me answer my research question is the analysis recorded from the data analysis I perform utilizing RStudio. In RStudio, it is possible to create graphs and plots from the data you have collected for your project with the several commands that are offered. Most likely, my program will output several graphs and plots that will answer questions that will ultimately answer the research question that I am presenting. For instance, if I wanted to create a plot that will describe how crime rate is usually lower in high income communities than lower income communities, I would specifically create a graph about a certain county in the US and display that. I would then research how wealthy that certain community is.

+ Outline the detailed steps of your experiment. To help visualize these steps create a technical diagram of your experimental steps (workflow of what you will do in your experiment).

#### Part 3
Please anticipate at least 100 words for this writing component.

Describe the execution of your experiment. What challenges did you encounter, if any?
```
In this experiment, I am trying to see if the wealth or the poverty of a certain community affects how high or how low the crime rate is. Like I stated before, I will be utilizing RStudio to perform this experiment. I will also still be utilzing the previous data from my prototype to perform this experiment. I would need to first filter the dataset so it only focus on what specific county in the US. The challenges I encountered while trying to complete this experiment was trying to figure out the best way to visualize the data. I, at first, did not know whether an area plot or a histogram would be the best way.

#### Part 4
Please anticipate at least 100 words for this writing component.

Describe the results you obtained from your experiment. What did you learn from its analysis?

```
The results I was able to obtain from this experiment were not surprising to me but interesting to look at. For this experiment, I looked at two specific counties in the United States, Philadelphia County, PA and Loudoun County, VA. Philadelpia County is known as a low income community in the United States and it is a popular location for several people to locate to. Loudoun County is one of the richest counties in the United States, which I never knew, and many do not usually locate here. From my analysis, I could see that the crime rate in Philadelphia County was higher compared to that of Loudoun. One can make an assumption that crime rates tend to be higher in lower income communities, and those who tend to more popular in the United States.
