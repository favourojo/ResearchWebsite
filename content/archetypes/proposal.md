1. What is the area of your research in your proposed project idea? What is your specific
proposed idea and why is it important? Motivate with references as relevant.

For my proposed project idea, the area of research I will be focusing on will be the area of Data Analytics, primarily focusing on analyzing data and creating hypotheses about a certain issue. My specific proposed idea involves the field of forensics because I am focusing on the crime rates in different counties in the United States of America. Not only will I have access to the specific crime rate of a certain community, but the different types of crimes committed and the amount of instances for each crime. With this information, I am able to make hypotheses on why these communities have higher rates of crime compared to other communities and also what factors make this happen. The factors I want to primarily focus on would be poverty within the individuals of the community and the wealth of the community itself.

2. What is already known in the literature about this problem area; where does your project’s
concentration of your own interests lie in this area? What goals have you set for this project?
Motivate with references as relevant.


After reading the articles I found for the particular assignment, the literature describes how individuals in the digital forensics field need to adopt more standardized, modular approaches for data representation and forensic processing. I personally am very interested in the field of forensics because I like to watch True Crime documentaries in my free time and they interest me. I always enjoyed the stories that each documentary would present and how every story is real. With each True Crime documentary I watched, I felt like I was learning new about the justice system here in the United States or something about certain communities in the US. I became more interested because I believe True Crime documentaries reveal something new about the US that is not talked about enough to gain notable attention. The goals I have set for this project to be able to create a full analysis about the crime rate in each community in the United States, whether it be negative or positive. Specifically, I would like to focus on the counties that are popular but are notably disadvantaged communities and also notable rich communities while also speaking on rich communities that are not very known. I believe the data set I utilized for my prototype assignment will also be the data I utilize for my project for my Senior composition. This particular data set includes the specific crime rate and the specific names of the crimes and also how many instances of them occur. I will also considering adding other data sets that contain information about poverty rate and wealth of the community, but with this information, I believe I can create a hypothesis with analysis about the data I collected.

3. What is the Gap between the field and the knowledge of the area? Why is this gap present
and what are the implications of the gap and what is your solution to try to bridge this gap?
Motivate with references as relevant.


I believe the knowledge gap present in the digital forensics field is that many people do not have a concrete understanding of forensic science, so the new technologies and enhancements introduced are not supported. This gap is present because many do not want to adapt with the new technologies that are being introduced everyday because some may not believe they are feasible to work with. With this gap present, the digital forensics field will be very far behind when it comes to advancements and updating because they refuse not to. The best solution, personally for me, would be to start working with the new technology because of many discoveries that could potentially be made if they were made. For instance, in the below citation, Jessica L. Metcalf is discussing microbe, which have the potential to be used as physical evidence for forensic science because they are ubiquitous and have predictable ecologies. However, developing this new forensic science technologies in the justice requires overcoming scientific, investigative, and legal hurdles, which many individuals are not ready for. To start using these new technologies, we would need to first educate individuals who are hesitant to adapt.

4. Using specifics, what is/are the research question(s) that motivate your research project?

I believe my project idea is very feasible and I would be able to complete in time concerning the deadlines that we will be given. AS of right now, the data set that I have imported contains information regarding the crime rates of every community in the United States of America and what those crimes are. For my project idea, I would be utilizing RStudio as my software tool because this specific tool focusing on data science and visualization of data analysis. I have utilized RStudio before in my Data Analytics course, so I already have experience with the tool and I believe I am able to learn even more about the tool that could enhance my project. I intend to follow this research question very far into my project because I believe it will bring in another aspect to my project that I was not familiar with. I initially wanted to primarily focus on the crime rate and instances of each community, but I believe bringing the aspect of poverty and even race would provide a more detailed analysis for my project.


5. Discuss the scope and feasibility of this work. For instance, what are the limits in your area
of research? How far do you indent to follow this research question?

I believe my project idea is very feasible and I would be able to complete in time concerning the deadlines that we will be given. AS of right now, the data set that I have imported contains information regarding the crime rates of every community in the United States of America and what those crimes are. For my project idea, I would be utilizing RStudio as my software tool because this specific tool focusing on data science and visualization of data analysis. I have utilized RStudio before in my Data Analytics course, so i already have experience with the tool and I believe I am able to even mroe learn about the tool that could enhance my project. I intend to follow this research question very far into my project because I believe it will bring in another aspect to my project that I was not familiar with. I initially wanted to primarily focus on the crime rate and instances of each community, but I believe bringing the aspect of poverty and even race would provide a more detailed analysis for my project.

6. Discuss the prototype you developed to demonstrate feasibility. Give an overview of its
design and implementation. Discuss any data and existing software/libraries/tools that were
necessary for the development of your prototype.

This prototype analyzes different aspects of crime inside the United States. In the program, users are able to import data sets from the Internet and create analysis about certain columns. The data set from this certain program displays the crime rate and the different crime instances from each county in the United States. I have already imported a data set that contains all the counties in the United States and all the crime that is committed in the particular community. I was able to utilize RStudio to complete my protoype. In order to run this program, RStudio allows users to run the program inside the console. Inside RStudio, I added the libraries tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science, and ggplot2, which is an enhanced data visualization package for R. With these packages installed inside the software, the program has all the necessary requirements to run effectively.

7. What evidence is there that the prototype will provide any support for your project? How
will your prototype be helpful in the planning, execution and completion of your research project?

In this experiment, I am trying to see if the wealth or the poverty of a certain community affects how high or how low the crime rate is. Like I stated before, I will be utilizing RStudio to perform this experiment. I will also still be utilizing the previous data from my prototype to perform this experiment. I would need to first filter the data set so it only focuses on a specific county in the US. The challenges I encountered while trying to complete this experiment was trying to figure out the best way to visualize the data. I, at first, did not know whether an area plot or a histogram would be the best way. I was able to create a visualization of the data that shows how a community such as Loudoun County, VA and Philadelphia County, PA have varying crime rates and how crime is different in a rich community that is not known very well and an underprivileged community that is known very well. The prototype will be helpful in completing my project because I have already created the basis of how I want my assignment to be and how I want to execute it. The results I was able to obtain from this experiment were not surprising to me but interesting to look at. For this experiment, I looked at two specific counties in the United States, Philadelphia County, PA and Loudoun County, VA. Philadelphia County is known as a low income community in the United States and it is a popular location for several people to locate to. Loudoun County is one of the richest counties in the United States, which I never knew, and many do not usually locate here. From my analysis, I could see that the crime rate in Philadelphia County was higher compared to that of Loudoun. One can make an assumption that crime rates tend to be higher in lower income communities, and those who tend to be more popular in the United States.


8. Discuss the experiment that you performed involving the prototype. What were the hypotheses and research question(s) of your experiment and what steps were taken to respond to them?

To reiterate, I am trying to see if the wealth or the poverty of a certain community affects the crime rate in a more positive or a negative way. Like I stated before, I will be utilizing RStudio to perform this experiment. The hypothesis that I made was that notoriety does play a role in crime in a negative way because the crime rate in Philadelphia was a lot higher than the one I captured from Loudoun County, so that shows that notoriety does play a role. I created a bar plot visualization to show the rate of crime in each community and which crime occurred the most. The steps I took to respond to the research questions was to first collect data from the specific counties, Loudoun County and Philadelphia County. Then, I create visualizations of the data to make analysis of the results I have created.


9. Discuss the results of the experiment. What was learned from applying these steps which will
be helpful to the completion of your project and the achieving the main goals of your research
project?

The results I was able to obtain from this experiment were not surprising to me but interesting to look at. Loudoun County is one of the richest counties in the United States, which I never knew, and many do not usually locate here. From my analysis, I could see that the crime rate in Philadelphia County was higher compared to that of Loudoun. One can make an assumption that crime rates tend to be higher in lower income communities, and those who tend to be more popular in the United States. Also, I learned from the results of the experiment is that even some rich counties have high crime rates even though it is believed they have fewer crime rates than other communities. For instance, the rate of larceny that was reported in Loudoun County, VA, which is known as one of the richest counties in the United States of America, was a lot higher than I had anticipated. I believe learning this will be very helpful for the completion of my project because it opens my eyes to new discoveries.

10. How did you explain and visualize your results from your experiment so that they could be
understood by those who are not in your field of research? Explain how these visualizations
could be used in your research project to help explain its foundations.

I would explain the results from a more community-based logic and also discuss how the United States treats wealthy and poor communities when it comes to poverty and also race. Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania is known as a predominantly black community and many believe the police intervention in the community is very poor and not benefiting to the community. Loudoun County, Virginia was a very rich and predominantly white community. From research, it can be assumed that law enforcement tends to focus on white communities in a positive and beneficial way compared to the negative side towards the Black community.

11. What ethical concerns are involved with your research? How will you recognize them and
how will you handle them once they are apparent?

I believe the ethical concerns involved with my research is that many individuals may be concerned about the crime rates and want to investigate more. It is possible for an individual to dwell more on the crime rate statistics and start to focus on the individual committing the crime and their specific features. For instance, if there are a large number of Black individuals committing a certain crime, I do not believe that should be the way individuals should interpret the data that I have collected. I want individuals to look at the data from a community stand point rather than from an individual standpoint. This could create some ethical concerns because that is not the focus of the project and the data.

12. What are the next steps to develop and complete your research project.

The next steps to develop and complete this project would be possibly gather more information from my peers here at Allegheny College. I believe that adding the aspect of the Allegheny College community brings in another aspect because the Allegheny College community is very diverse. I believe if I was able to collect data from my peers here at Allegheny, I could create more analysis for my project and also potentially add the experiences each individual had in their specific community. The data set I have already contains an abundant amount of information about each community of the United States, but I believe it would be also interesting to include a more personal view of how crime in a community is.
