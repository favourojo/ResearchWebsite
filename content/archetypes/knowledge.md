### Bridging the Gap Between the Known and Unknown

After reading through the research articles I have selected, there was a common theme between them all that there was several challenges present in the digital forensics field. The knowledge gap that emerges is many people do not have a concrete understand of forensic science, so the new technologies and enhancements introduced are not supported.

In this article, the author is discussing microbes, which have the potential to be used as physical evidence for forensic because they are ubiquitous and have predictable ecologies. However, developing and transitioning new forensic science technologies into the justice system requires overcoming scientific, investigative, and legal hurdles. This shows that there is an apparent knowledge gaps in the science of microbiome technology.

In the article by Anil K. Jain and Arun Ross, the two author discuss the concept of biometric recognition, which refers to automated recognition of individuals based on their behavioral and biological characteristics. Concerning forensic science, biometrics relates to the success in the field and also law enforcement applications with the success of fingerprints. However, despite these successful deployments, there are still several existing challenges and new opportunities for person recognition using biometrics.

In this article, the authors describe the knowledge gap that is present in formal reasoning for some forensic practitioners, and the limited understanding of case-specific research. They also offer teaching and research strategies that can help increase the epistemic status, which means the confidence in, and the justification of knowledge, of forensic science claims. This could add more creditability to the field of forensic science.

Frempong, Michael Adjei, and Kamal Kant Hiran. "Awareness and Understanding of Computer Forensics in the Ghana Legal System." International Journal of Computer Applications 975 (2014): 8887. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamal-Hiran/publication/263000273_Awareness_and_Understanding_of_Computer_Forensics_in_the_Ghana_Legal_System/links/59d87b72458515a5bc24ed6d/Awareness-and-Understanding-of-Computer-Forensics-in-the-Ghana-Legal-System.pdf

In this article, the focus is shifted from how the field of digital forensics' effects in the United States to how it is in the country of Ghana. This article emphasizes the effect digital forensics has on digital evidence especially in trial situations and how there needs be more understanding of the field. In Ghana, courtroom and legal issues relevant to computer/digital forensics are extensive and they differ with respect to procedural evidence rules that ensure reliability of the evidence. In cases, electronic evidence is very fundamental for evidence.

The research question I purposed after reading through the articles is:
How can there be more understanding about the field of digital forensics if there is need for enhancement in the field?

I will research more about the digital forensics and forensics data field. I will also understand the new developments and technologies that are being proposed by other researchers. I will finally analyze the connections between forensic science and other real world field, ex. Law enforcement and biology.
