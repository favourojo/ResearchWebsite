## Literature Analysis



### Survey Article from the literature


 - Citation of the article

M. Al Fahdi, N. L. Clarke and S. M. Furnell, "Challenges to digital forensics: A survey of researchers & practitioners attitudes and opinions," 2013 Information Security for South Africa, 2013, pp. 1-8, doi: 10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641058.

 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

The authors of this article present this research so they can identify, quantify, and prioritize the challenges that exist in the digital forensics field. Once these challenges are tackled, future efforts can be concentrated on the issues that actually affect the domain


 - What is are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

The general tasks that the methods address are to understand the general forensic background of participants, in order to appreciate the relevancy of responses. Also, to understand what participants feel the role of digital forensics is and to what extent it is currently able to meet that requirement. Finally, you'll need to understand what (if any) impact changes in future technology will have upon forensic investigations (from both a law enforcement and organizational
perspective).


 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

The methods taken for this survey was very affected for getting results. There was a number of trials runs of the survey were undertaken by local researchers in the domain acting as participants. The survey was also published online, and the researcher shortlist3ed potential participants from the identified stakeholder communities who were emailed directly.

 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

 After reading through the discussion, it seems that some of the challenges arising around the forensic community will still continue to become increasingly challenges. Since digital forensics becomes continuously outdated, other developing areas of technology such as cloud computing and social networks appeal more to future concerns. Also, individuals from the survey believe that future research should focus upon approaches such as criminal profiling and automation.

 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?


With the survey technique, I could take the survey to obtain data for a future database I could create for my future project. With the data I collect, I could create analysis similar to how the author of this article did.

### First article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

 Garfinkel, Simson L. “Digital Forensics Research: The next 10 Years.” Digital Investigation, Elsevier, 2 Aug. 2010, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287610000368.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The goal of this article is to inspire the community of individuals in the digital forensics to adopt more standardized, modular approaches for data representation and forensic processing.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 Simon Garfinkel, the author of this article, believes that today's Golden Age of computer forensics is quickly coming to an end. Throughout the article, he describes how he believes that forensic research will fall behind in the market, the tools created to perform digital forensics will become increasingly obsolete, and prominent figures such as law enforcement, the military and other users of computer forensics products will not be able to rely on the results of forensic analysis. So, to prevent this, Garfinkel introduces some more standardized approaches that could continue the future of forensic data analysis.

### Second article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

 Kim, Soram, Myungseo Park, Sehoon Lee, and Jongsung Kim. 2020. "Smart Home Forensics—Data Analysis of IoT Devices" Electronics 9, no. 8: 1215. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9081215

 - What is the goal of this article?

The goal of this article is to put emphasis on the importance of smart home data for digital forensics.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 The main goal of the article is to promote the field of digital forensics while also crediting the application of smart homes. Since smart homes are based on Internet of Thing (IoT) devices such as sensors, cameras, and lights, they can be controlled through controllers such as smartphones and smart speakers. While promoting the field of digital forensics, the author of this article is also encouraging readers to learn how to acquire, classify, and analyze smart home data from Google Nest Hub, Samsung SmartThings, and Kasa cam for forensic purposes.
