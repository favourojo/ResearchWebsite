1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

When it comes to computer specifications, there are really only basic requirements that need to be fulfilled for my research project idea I believe. For the operation systems, if you are running on Windows, Windows 10 is recommended when it comes to data analysis. Linux can also be easily run virtually.

2. Tools: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

For my project, RStudio would probably be the software tool that would be the most needed for analysis. This is because RStudio is the most useful tool if data analysis is needed. I also would add SQLite as another software because I would like to attempt to create my own database for my project idea as of right now. For programming languages, I would primarily utilize R because that is the most utilized language when it comes to data science and analysis.

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

I have experience utilized the programming tools and languages that I have mentioned in the previous questions. I have utilized RStudio in my Data Analytics class and it interested me enough that I wanted to continuing pursuing the tool. I understand how to use RStudio to analyze data by creating graphs and plots. With SQLite, I am slowly learning how to create my own database and create queries to then create analysis on the data. I am also taking a Database Systems class to increase my understanding on databases.

4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

I believe my project will require the use of existing data, and since I am focusing on forensics, it was be some type of forensics data. I do not know as of right now how much will be sufficient data for me to use in my proposed project.

5. Time: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

I would anticipate about a couple months for the completion of my project. If I am using existing data, it would take some time for to find the right data for my project. I would then have to condense the data if needed so that would also take some time. I am anticipating that majority of my time would be specifically the implementation of the project.

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

I am expecting to make suitable connections with my data and then with those connections, I would like make my own analysis based on the specific connections. I could then create a hypothesis and with that I can continue to make analysis that could potentially prove my hypothesis.

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

I will analyze my results by potentially creating plots and graphs that could answer research questions I have about my proposed idea. I will continue to create plots and graphs so that I can see if the connections I am making are reasonable connections.

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

At this moment, I would need to research my project to see what other resources are needed to complete the project. If there is a programming language, which I expect is a big possibility, I am willing to do that because with this extra skill, my project could be even more informative and interesting.

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

I think my biggest issue might be when it pertains to forensic data, individuals might already make analysis on the certain topic I choose that might disprove the hypothesis I create. In this case, I could easily discuss why the hypothesis is not true instead of proving why it is true.
